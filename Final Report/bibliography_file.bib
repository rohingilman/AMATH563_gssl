	abstract = {Graph-based semi-supervised learning is the problem of propagating labels from a small number of labelled data points to a larger set of unlabelled data. This paper is concerned with the consistency of optimization-based techniques for such problems, in the limit where the labels have small noise and the underlying unlabelled data is well clustered. We study graph-based probit for binary classification, and a natural generalization of this method to multi-class classification using one-hot encoding. The resulting objective function to be optimized comprises the sum of a quadratic form defined through a rational function of the graph Laplacian, involving only the unlabelled data, and a fidelity term involving only the labelled data. The consistency analysis sheds light on the choice of the rational function defining the optimization.},

	abstract = {Gaussian processes are a versatile framework for learning unknown functions in a manner that permits one to utilize prior information about their properties. Although many different Gaussian process models are readily available when the input space is Euclidean, the choice is much more limited for Gaussian processes whose input space is an undirected graph. In this work, we leverage the stochastic partial differential equation characterization of Mat{\textbackslash}'ern Gaussian processes - a widely-used model class in the Euclidean setting - to study their analog for undirected graphs. We show that the resulting Gaussian processes inherit various attractive properties of their Euclidean and Riemannian analogs and provide techniques that allow them to be trained using standard methods, such as inducing points. This enables graph Mat{\textbackslash}'ern Gaussian processes to be employed in mini-batch and non-conjugate settings, thereby making them more accessible to practitioners and easier to deploy within larger learning frameworks.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates Gaussian Markov random field approximations to nonstationary Gaussian fields using graph representations of stochastic partial differential equations. We establish approximation error guarantees building on the theory of spectral convergence of graph Laplacians. The proposed graph representations provide a generalization of the Mat{\textbackslash}'ern model to unstructured point clouds, and facilitate inference and sampling using linear algebra methods for sparse matrices. In addition, they bridge and unify several models in Bayesian inverse problems, spatial statistics and graph-based machine learning. We demonstrate through examples in these three disciplines that the unity revealed by graph representations facilitates the exchange of ideas across them.},
